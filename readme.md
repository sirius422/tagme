# tagme

A python script to batch tag images according to the filename, it's intended to deal with the images downloaded with [PixivBatchDownloader](https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivBatchDownloader)

Now only works on Unix/Linux, I may add support for windows later. [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) is needed for this script to work. Read the source code for more information.
